    "I discovered my passion for software during my sophomore year at Northwestern University. After a few lectures of EECS 111, I knew that I had found what I wanted to dedicate myself to.",
    "Over the rest of my time in college, I spent my time learning all about code. Whether it be through a hackathon, a personal project, or just plain reading, I immersed myself in the world of software development.",
    "Since then, Iâ€™ve gained experience in the industry working as a software engineer in many forms. I tackled the challenges of writing firmware and API libraries for Internet of Things devices and services. I met customer requirements when implementing a new feature for a cloud-based product built on Java and an Oracle database. And now, I contribute as an engineer on a scrum team delivering one of the newest and most exciting products our company has to offer.",
